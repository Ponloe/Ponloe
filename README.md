# 👋 Hey there! I'm Ponloe

I'm a Computer Science student at Paragon International University.

🛠 I love creating tools that solve real problems—from automating workflows to streamlining file management. Whether it's backend APIs with Laravel or full-stack apps using Next.js and NestJS, I'm always curious about how systems work and how they can work better.

## 💼 Experience
- **Software Engineering Intern @ SQUEEEZE** – Built a shift management system with Django, handled backend architecture and database design.
- **Techpreneur Bootcamp** – A 9-month program blending full-stack dev with startup thinking, co-hosted by DICHI Academy and Qwasar Silicon Valley.

## 🧰 Stack I’m most comfortable with
`C++`, `Python`, `JavaScript`, `TypeScript`, `PHP`, `SQL`  
`React`, `Next.js`, `NestJS`, `Laravel`, `Django`, `Bootstrap`
